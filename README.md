- the goal of the application:
Using both Web Audio API and Nexus UI I created an electric piano that my users can play!
My application also allows users to change the waveforms of the piano, for example by selecting sine, triangle, square and sawtooth at the top of the screen. 
the basic documentation that tells the user to press on the keys to play the piano greets the user whent he or she first visits the page, and also at the top right corner of the screen where the question mark resides.

- challenges faced in realizing the application:
The main challenge I faced was making the piano sound like a real piano. However, after learning more about pianos and their frequencies I was able to make a better (although still not perfect) sounding piano. 

- the instructions:
Press on the keys and make some music!

Page validates.
User Interaction: there are 12 keys and 4 selector buttons for the user to interact with, and change sounds.
